title: "PM1: A Foundation Model Fusing Genotype, Phenotype, and Image for Precision Medicine"
description: "The paper presents PM1, a multimodal model that combines genetics, clinical traits, and retinal images to better capture patient health than any single data type alone. It learns from incomplete data, improves disease prediction, and enables cross-modal tasks like inferring genotypes from images or generating retinal photos. A GWAS on its fused representations also recovers known canonical assocations, showing PM1 learns meaningful signals."

# Abstract

The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely.

# Introduction

Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory and gated recurrent neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures.

# Model Architecture

The Transformer follows the overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1, respectively.

## Encoder and Decoder Stacks

**Encoder:** The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization.

**Decoder:** The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack.

## Attention

An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.

### Scaled Dot-Product Attention

We call our particular attention "Scaled Dot-Product Attention". The input consists of queries and keys of dimension $d_k$, and values of dimension $d_v$. We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by $\sqrt{d_k}$, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.

## Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks

In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.

# Results

We evaluate our models on two machine translation tasks. On the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0 BLEU, establishing a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4.

# Conclusion

In this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention. The Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers.
