title: "Polygenic risk and association beyond linearity"
description: "We present GenomEn, a new genotype-to-phenotype model that captures genetic interactions missed by standard additive PRS methods. Across 20 UK Biobank traits, GenomEn outperforms competing methods by 21% on average, recovering known gene–gene interactions and revealing non-additive patterns in trait architecture. This suggests part of the missing heritability gap, the deviation between currently predicted and theoretically achievable heritability, can be attributed to nonlinear effects. GenomEn also includes the X chromosome, boosting performance for X-linked traits like male-pattern baldness."
